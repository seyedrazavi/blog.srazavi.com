In a previous post, I introduced phenomenology, a philosophical discipline that attempts to makes sense of the first-person experience of conscious beings like us. In this post, I will present some worries about the method and consider the strong objection against phenomology raised by the philosopher Daniel Dennett.

Firstly, some may object by saying that the process of capturing descriptions is unreliable. This objection could equally be levelled at some psychological experiments which are as reliant on descriptive reporting of the behaviour or mental acts of their subjects. The worry about reliability may thus be addressed by various methodological approaches such as the phenomenological. Indeed, it must be if we are to consider qualitative factors at all in our scientific explanations.

A further worry may be raised when considering whether the epoché sets an impossible task in trying to bracket the natural attitude. We might also question whether it is even desirable for practitioners of a science to adopt a stance at odds with the natural attitude. However, in practice this isn’t an expectation of some zen-like state of ambivalence but more a methodological check against pre-empting description with theoretical considerations. Instead of describing the observed phenomena through the lens of say behaviourist theory, the phenomenologist attempts to describe the experience just as it appears. That she will be pulled towards explaining what is observed in terms of theory is unavoidable. What is required is philosophical reflection to correct for the impulse. 

Yet another objection may be made in regard to the process of formalisation and translation. In general, formalisation is accepted practice within science and thus it does not seem to be reasonable to deny it a role when dealing with phenomenal experience. The question of corroboration of translated forms of notation between first- and third-person is more of an empirical question. If it turns out that phenomenological and psychological formalisations are incommensurate, there may be good reason to suspect naturalising efforts within phenomenology. Depending on whether you believe all pursuits of knowledge must be naturalisable or not, this may be where you get off the bus if you've gotten this far at all.

Now let me turn to the strong opposition of Daniel Dennett towards the whole phenomenological enterprise. Alongside the set of principled objections against the phenomenological method expressed in _Consciousness Explained_, Dennett gives his own alternative method of 'heterophenomenology'. Dennett’s method takes the first-person reporting as raw data to be fitted against behaviourist and instrumental data, from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and the like. In that sense, it fits neatly within the spectrum of methods already employed by experimental psychology and cognitive neuroscience.  

It is not my aim here to argue against Dennett’s heterophenomenology but rather to examine his objections against the kind of phenomenology grounded in Husserl’s method. Dennett’s objection can be categorised into two problems for the phenomenologist:

**The False Positive Problem**: “Some beliefs that subjects have about their own conscious states are provably false, and hence what needs explanation in these cases is the etiology of the false belief” (Dennett, 2001). 

**The False Negative Problem**: “Some psychological things that happen in people (to put it crudely but neutrally) are unsuspected by those people.  People not only volunteer no information on these topics; when provoked to search, they find no information on these topics. But a forced choice guess, for instance, reveals that nevertheless, there is something psychological going on” (ibid).

One may consider that the phenomenologist’s response to the first problem would be to deny claiming infallibility for their method. In fact, the method is designed to guard against error through intersubjective verification. What the phenomenologist claims is direct not infallible knowledge. In the former sense, we have access to the content of our minds without mediation. There is no gap between thought and mind.

Phenomenological research is equally concerned with understanding the cause of mischaracterization of experience. Such analysis is often undertaken with the use of dynamical systems theory, using mathematical models to consider why one subject’s experience may differ with another’s and how intersubjective meaning is negotiated amongst different subjects. It is with a similar approach that phenomenologists may deal with Dennett’s second problem of missing information in one subject’s experience. 

The fundamental difference in approach is between whether facts are arrived at from the third-person perspective or whether facts are negotiated through complex systems analysis of first-person reporting. That these approaches consider different criteria for justification of the facts is indisputable but for the phenomenologist perhaps they are not incommensurate.

Having presented Husserlian phenomenology as a method by which we can examine the first-person examination lived experience, I have defended it against some common objections. I have also presented the principled position of Dennett, considering briefly some possible replies. I think there are some good reasons to pursue a program of research using the phenomenological method with an expectation that it may be fruitful. However, the challenge to make it broadly compatible with natural science remains.
