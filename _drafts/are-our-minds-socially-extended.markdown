The extended mind thesis argues that at least some cognition happens outside the brain. A more radical proposal by Eros Moreira de Carvalho proposes that some mental processes are constituted by social actions. In this post, I'll examine the argument for _the socially extended mind thesis_ (SEMT). I'll do this by way of first presenting its foundations: the extended mind thesis and Gibson's Affordances. 

## The Extended Mind Thesis (EMT)

In their 1998 paper, Andy Clark and David Chalmers introduced the parity principle as the basis of the extended mind thesis:

> "If, as we confront some task, a part of the world functions as a process which, were it done in the head, we would have no hesitation in recognizing as part of the cognitive process, then that part of the world is (so we claim) part of the cognitive process." (Clark and Chalmers, 1998)

As an example, they provide the case of Inga and Otto who want to make their way to a museum. Otto has a Alzheimer's disease and relies upon a notebook to capture all information he may need to remember. Whereas Inga accesses her memory to remember the way, Otto consults his notebook. Clark and Chalmers argue that by the parity principle, Otto's notebook acts as part of the cognitive process. In this way, Otto's mind is extended into his notebook.

Another example, provided by way of Merleau-Ponty (2012), is of a blind man who uses his cane to navigate the world. Whilst the man feels the cane at first in his hand, after a time of protacted use it becomes transparent to him. The assimilated use of the cane extends his tactile perception. By the parity principle, the cane is now an extension of the blind man's cognitive process of perception.

The main lesson de Carvalho wishes to draw from the EMT is that by use of these actions - consulting a notebook or feeling around with a cane - the cognitive labour is distributed. The computational work of turning information in the environment into something that is useful is outsourced. Furthermore, this process is transparent. As far as Otto is concerned he is remembering the way by consulting his notebook. As far as the blind man is concerned, he is feeling what is around him when he probes with his cane.

## Gibson's Affordances

Prior to Gibson (2015 [1979]), the prevalant view of perception was an input-output model. Sensations were inputs into a cognitive system that processed the raw information resulting in further cognitive processes or actions. This view lent itself to the snapshot view of vision. Researchers were tasked with experiments that observed subjects under ideal conditions of stillness. The eye was considered analogous to a camera. The job of the scientist was to isolate the information channels to the brain. Once the information was in the brain a picture could be formed.

However, Gibson believed this view was misguided. The main issue was how to parameterise all the incoming information in such a way as to compute it. Representing all that data to form a picture was a formidable cognitive task. Instead, Gibson proposed a much simpler mechanism. Beginning with surface textures, broad strokes of the perceptual picture could be painted. The relationship between objects and their environment would be fixed (termed 'invariants'). This invariant information would be "stored" in the world and perceptually retrieved as needed. 

This rich informational structural in the environment called for a different experimental approach. The focus became stimulus flux in situations where the perceiver moves his head and body through the environment. The invariants emerge only through a period of prolonged interaction between the perceiver and environment. Action is not only necessary to produce the stimulus flux but also generates the information contained by picking out the invariants.

Again the main take away for de Carvalho is that the perceiver offloads the cognitive work to the ongoing interaction with the environment. Furthermore, the old separation between input-outputs and processing is dissolved. Computation is no longer separated from action. 

This process of picking out invariants is crucial to controlling behaviour. This is captured in Gibson's theory of affordance. Behaviour is controlled by the affordances of the environment, i.e. what is perceived as possible to do. It is a relational term encompassing both the animal and its environment. The affordances are what actions the animal can take based on its bodily and cognitive abilities. These abilities are in turn the functions that have evolved or developed in the animal as an aid to its survival and flourishing. Abilities keep the animal adjusted to its environment and affordances in the environment interact with animals in determining their abilities. 

## Social Affordances

The next step is in extending the theory of affordances into the cultural meanings of objects. An example from Gibson suggests a postbox "affords letter-mailing to a letter-writing human in a community with a postal system" (2015, 130). In this example, the affordance of letter-mailing connects to the ability of letter-writing via the social affordance of a postal system. 

Social affordances are related to social practices. Such practices are an example of what Gibson calls behavior that affords behaviour. To see what some animal or person can do, to see what they afford, is a way of perceiving their mind. To see what a postbox affords, one is dependent on perceiving what others afford. That there is a postal worker who collects the mail. That there are letter writers who will post letters. That receiving an envelope in the post means there is a letter to read. 

This activity of cooperative interactions through social practices is the way in which de Carvalho argues our minds are socially extended. The social environment stores the information we need to make sense of some of the objects we encounter. In particular, situations where animals are exploring phenomenon jointly. For example, in the subtleties of body language or gazing at features of region or object in the environment. This ability for joint attention allows animals to coordinate behaviour in order to communicate and establish group bonds. Experiments with infants indicate this ability is developed early and is vital to pre-linguistic coping with the world.

## Is the mind socially extended?

Now SEMT has been presented, I will consider a couple of concerns.

Firstly, it should be obvious that if you have worries about EMT or Gibson's Affordances, SEMT may suffer from similar problems. In particular, if you don't find cognitive offloading to the environment as enough to suggest extension of the mind in the relevant sense. It seems to me that only a very narrow sense of cognition as information processing could justify the parity principle. Clearly information look up in Otto's case is computational. If all that remembering consisted of was looking up information then Inga and Otto's situations are no different. Whether this is all that occurs when we remember is uncertain. We don't need to suggest what is missing is necessarily phenomenal or indeed a conscious process. Perhaps all it needs is to be sufficiently integrated in the whole cognitive architecture. Clark and Chalmers think Otto's notebook or the blind-man's cane are sufficiently coupled to qualify.   

Secondly, there is a worry whether the transposition of visual affordances to social affordances is a justified move. In the case of joint attention, it is not entirely clear what information is stored in the social environment as part of the affordance. Mind reading, as in the infant examples, certainly depends in some cases on visual perception. In so far as visual perception can be studied usefully in the Gibsonian manner, there are affordances. But what cultural meaning is stored externally to the perceiver, especially for the infant? The leap from gaze direction as a pre-linguistic information channel to social affordances perhaps needs more argument.

Overall, de Carvalho's thesis brings together two interesting strands of enactivism and makes a decent case for the social extension of cognition. However, if you are not already convinced by EMT, you will find this form of enactivism difficult to accept. Even so, I think there is something interesting to be developed in the notion of social affordances and the application of Gibson's theory outside of the area of visual perception.
