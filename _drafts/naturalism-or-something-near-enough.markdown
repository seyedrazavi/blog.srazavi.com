What's the right way to do philosophy when you care about science? Sometimes, this question is misunderstood as prioritising science over all other human efforts to obtain knowledge or human endeavours in general. I think those who think science can answer questions of value or that the only type of things we can know are scientific facts have not really thought hard enough. But that is a topic for another time. For now, I want to talk about the kind of philosophy that I am trying to do. The kind of philosophy that is concerned with something I think *is* subject to investigation by the natural and special sciences. My concerns are [questions about minds](https://blog.srazavi.com/essays/journal/2021/05/05/thinking-about-aboutness.html) and I think this is a topic that it is perfectly reasonable to assume science can tell us a lot about. So, given this what kind of philosophy is appropriate? Or less charitably, why am I studying philosophy and not cognitive science?

I want to tackle this question in three parts. First, I want to defend the value of philosophy in a scientific enterprise. Second, I want to lay out my commitment to a kind of natural explanation and how that accords with my wider openness to non-scientific forms of knowledge. And finally, I want to say a little about why I reject the stronger form of naturalism that is called reductive physicalism. These are all fairly tentative positions for me. They also rarely come up explicitly in the stuff I write except in rough gestures. But making them explicit here is a useful exercise and maybe someone will push me on these points in a productive fashion.

## Natural Explanations and Humble Epistemologies
