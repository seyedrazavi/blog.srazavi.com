In this post, I hope to introduce you to phenomenology, a philosophical discipline that attempts to makes sense of the first-person experience of conscious beings like us. This will be a summary of the approach and why it may be a fruitful one. In a subsequent post, I'll consider some worries about the approach and defend it against one of its detractors, namely Daniel Dennett.

Husserl’s phenomenology attempts to provide careful analysis of descriptions of lived experience. For Husserl and subsequent phenomenologists, the distinction between ‘inner’ and ‘outer’ experience was a metaphysical fallacy So, in this regard, the phenomenological method doesn’t consider itself as a form of introspective psychology. Its primary concern is the phenomena of experience and the conditions of their possibility. It rejects the view that the reality of the objects of our experience are hidden behind their appearances. Although admitting that appearances may not match, for example as a matter of how things appear under different circumstances, the phenomenologist doesn’t believe this makes phenomenology something distinct from science, concerned only with how things seem. Instead, Husserl regarded phenomenology as providing a new epistemic foundation for science.

With this quick sketch given, it’s worth considering the key elements of a naturalised phenomenological method. These are (i) the epoché, (ii) the phenomenological reduction, (iii) eidetic variation, (iv) intersubjective verification, (v) formalization, and (vi) translation.

In order to understand the procedure Husserl called **epoché**, we have to first understand what Husserl names the _natural attitude_.  This is the default commonplace position we hold that we are minds experiencing a “theory-independent reality”. Thus, the aim of science, and science alone, is to obtain objectively valid knowledge of this reality. 

In contrast to this view, phenomenologists say third-person science is not the only means by which we can obtain positive knowledge. Philosophy is there to investigate the basis by which this broader knowledge is possible. However, to achieve this difficult task, we have to bracket our acceptance of the natural attitude. This suspension of our natural inclination is the epoché. At its core, it involves focusing on reality as it is given to us in the appearances of the objects of experience without recourse to theory-laden explanations. In practice, this means recording detailed descriptions of our first-person experience. So, we might record that we are looking at a red star-patterned ball in a child’s room that reminds us of our playing together earlier.

If this seems like introspection, the phenomenologist would argue the mistake is in assuming our mental acts belong to a closed interior realm. Rather, the phenomenologist sees the objects of thoughts, as made manifest to our consciousness, as being constituted for us in varying aspects by the objects themselves. There is no view from nowhere, no objective third-person vantage by which we can analyse this world. We ourselves are not another object in the world but rather the subject for the world.  In describing our experiences, we are not therefore merely describing re-presentations of our experiences but our experiences in toto.  Our description of the experience of looking at the red star-patterned ball is not merely a third-person description of a propositional attitude of some subject. It is my lived experience.

In the analysis phase of the philosophical reflection that follows, there is the **phenomenological reduction**, which attempts to correlate the interdependence between specific structures of our lived experience with the ways in which these experiences appear to us. In this phenomenological attitude, we are interested not only in the mental act but also in the subject which is experiencing the mental act. As distinct from the psychotherapist, the phenomenologist is also interested in the world of the subject as described through these experiences. Therefore, the method captures epistemic claims about the world and subject, not merely psychological facts. In describing the experience of looking at the red star-patterned ball, we capture the perceptual experience and disposition of the subject, but we also say something about the world in which there is such a ball and such a room.

In addition to the epoché and reduction, traditional phenomenologists make use of two other tools. The **eidetic variation** is the procedure used to find the invariant characteristics of the things we experience (ibid, 30). Here we consider the objects of our thought and attempt to imagine them without the contingent characteristics they have in order to discover what can be taken away without changing what the object is to us. Some characteristics (when modified) change the object so it is unrecognisable, and these are the invariant structures that constitutes the object. For example, from the experience of a red star-patterned ball in a child’s room we might strip away first the colour and still find the ball recognisable. Then taking everything but the shape of the ball away, leaving it with no colour, design or location, we grasp what it is for the ball to be a ball _qua_ ball. 

Finally, the experience analysed for its invariant structures, these can be corroborated with the experience of others. This **intersubjective verification** process identifies the structures of our experiences such that we are no longer narrowly tied to a single subject’s perspective. Here we transition from the individual experience of the red star-patterned ball to the universally recognised structure of the experience of a ball. 

Later neuro-phenomenologists have attempted to bring this methodology into a naturalised framework by formalising phenomenological descriptions using a notation proposed by Marbach. The next step in this process is translation where the resultant formal notation can then be compared mathematically with third-person reports from empirical psychology similarly formalised. So, it might be that first- and third-person accounts could be mapped to provide a combined naturalised account of experience. Whether this is successful awaits more evidence. Neuro-phenomenologists such as Dan Zahavi are at the forefront of its application, reporting some substantive success.

Now that I have introduced phenomology, the method used to analyse the contents of our experience, in a subsequent post I will consider some worries and the strong objection raised against it by the philosopher Daniel Dennett.
