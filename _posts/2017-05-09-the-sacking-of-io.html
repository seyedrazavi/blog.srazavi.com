<p id="9668" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Vitya watched the speckled panorama, crowded tubes intersecting the domes of the habitats. Each blurred pixel a man, woman or child. Any one of them like him, once an ovum delivered to seed the manufactories of a new world. The spectrum of colours became coarse blocks as the ship rotated in high-orbit. Only the yellow dappled surface of the moon in view.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p id="dcee" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When the image returned with clarity, Vitya gave the order: &ldquo;Deliver the payload.&rdquo;</p>
<p id="073e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Leaning on the helmsman&rsquo;s chair, Vitya&rsquo;s gold-trimmed white uniform glistened. The on-deck cameras recorded everything for posterity. Above each of the command crew, a terminal display fluctuated with mission telemetry. The UESS Calliope locked into a geostationary orbit. Keeping a synchronistic distance from the other destroyers in the group. The first wave bombs locked on to their targets. Power generators and the tethering lines locking orbital platforms to the ground.</p>
<p id="41b7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The projection displayed a warped expanding brown circle with a black smokey edge.</p>
<p id="bb40" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">&ldquo;Assess impact,&rdquo; Vitya said. &ldquo;And begin the second-wave.&rdquo;</p>
<p id="c304" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The target profiles changed. Black fields of vegetation blazed in expanding concentric circles of plasma. The oxygen-producing vines evaporated into the sulphur dioxide atmosphere.</p>
<p id="e262" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The bridge lights turned red. On the display, an icon circled a flash-point on the surface. Some twelve kilometres from the main cluster of domes. The ship&rsquo;s AI identified a launch, on an escape velocity.</p>
<p id="c5aa" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">&ldquo;Could be missiles,&rdquo; the weapon&rsquo;s officer Sami said.</p>
<p id="cff5" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">&ldquo;Or colonists trying to make an escape,&rdquo; Evelyn, the seasoned first officer countered.</p>
<p id="e0e6" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">&ldquo;Set course to intercept,&rdquo; Vitya brought the discussion to an end. &ldquo;Nobody is leaving Io.&rdquo; Using an encrypted channel to the other ships, &ldquo;Continue bombardment, intercepting launch craft.&rdquo;</p>
<p id="0339" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The ship&rsquo;s movement around the planet&rsquo;s orbit had no impact on the localised gravity of the bridge. In half a minute, the civilian transport was within sight.</p>
<p id="f7d0" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">&ldquo;No comms,&rdquo; Vitya pulled up the mission protocols on the screen for all to see. &ldquo;Destroy it.&rdquo;</p>
<p id="9739" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Sixteen Actaeon missiles arced from the sides of the Calliope. Bright bubbles of bursting nuclear payloads and high-intensity radiation expanding.</p>
<p id="87fc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Calliope&rsquo;s loudspeakers synthesised a warning, &ldquo;Unidentified projectile on collision trajectory.&rdquo;</p>
<p id="b55e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A small conical pod, about two metres long, hit the ship&rsquo;s hull. Stabilisers steadied the impact. The tail of the Calliope inked with black hexagons. Webbing spread outwards from the point of impact like shattering glass. A gooey spiral consuming the alloyed structure.</p>
<p id="6662" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a nanite bomb!&rdquo; Sami cried.</p>
<p id="9341" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">&ldquo;Suit up,&rdquo; Vitya snapped into action.</p>
<p id="90f7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The crew raced to the forward escape hatch, a shuttle waiting. The black goop clipped forward. The hazard lights went off, systems deactivated.</p>
<p id="2b38" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s leaving the weapon systems intact,&rdquo; Evelyn said.</p>
<p id="5801" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Gesturing for her to board the shuttle, Vitya closed the hatch. He sprinted to the starboard engines. The nanite swarm crawled the walls like a gravity-defying oil slick. Cutting a path to the casing of the rocket boosters, he had no final words.</p>
<p id="2de6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">From the shuttle, the crew watched the Calliope fracture, burning up in Io&rsquo;s atmosphere.</p>
