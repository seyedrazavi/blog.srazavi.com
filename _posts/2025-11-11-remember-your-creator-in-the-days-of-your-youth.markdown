There is a story told of a young woman named Selene. In her youth she was radiant with energy, her days filled with song, friendship, and bold plans for the future. She imagined time would always be hers to spend, her body always supple, her mind always sharp. But years passed. Her hair grayed, her eyesight dimmed, her steps slowed. One morning she tried to sing an old song and found her voice cracked, the notes trembling. Looking into the mirror, she hardly recognized herself. It was then she remembered the words spoken to her as a girl: *Do not forget your Creator while you are young, before the days come when you find no pleasure in them.*  

> “Remember your Creator in the days of your youth,  
>     before the days of trouble come and the years approach when you will say,  
>     ‘I find no pleasure in them’,   
> before the sun and the light and the moon and the stars grow dark,  
>     and the clouds return after the rain;  
> when the keepers of the house tremble,  
>     and the strong men stoop,  
> when the grinders cease because they are few,  
>     and those looking through the windows grow dim;  
> when the doors to the street are closed  
>     and the sound of grinding fades;  
> when people rise up at the sound of birds,  
>     but all their songs grow faint;  
> when people are afraid of heights and of dangers in the streets;  
> when the almond tree blossoms  
>     and the grasshopper drags itself along  
>     and desire no longer is stirred.  
> Then people go to their eternal home  
>     and mourners go about the streets.  
> Remember him, before the silver cord is severed,  
>     and the golden bowl is broken;  
> before the pitcher is shattered at the spring,  
>     and the wheel broken at the well,  
> and the dust returns to the ground it came from,  
>     and the spirit returns to God who gave it.  
> “Meaningless! Meaningless!” says the Teacher.  
>     “Everything is meaningless!”  
> *(Ecclesiastes 12:1–8, NIV)*  

This passage is one of the most haunting in Scripture. It is poetry of decline, a vivid allegory of aging: trembling limbs, fading eyes, failing teeth, fading voices, waning desire. It reminds us that the body, once vibrant, bends toward frailty, and that death waits at the end. Against this backdrop, the Teacher gives a singular counsel: *remember your Creator in the days of your youth.*  

Augustine understood memory not only as storage of the past but as the theater of the soul’s relation to God. To remember God in youth is not merely to recall an idea but to anchor desire early, before the scattering of age. Paul Ricoeur developed the idea of *narrative identity*: we live by weaving past, present, and future into a story. To forget the Creator in youth is to weave a story that unravels with age, for it lacks an eternal thread. To remember is to inscribe God into the plot of our lives, so that even as the body declines, the story retains coherence.  

Simone de Beauvoir, in *The Coming of Age*, observed how modern society marginalizes the elderly, treating them as invisible, irrelevant, or burdensome. She insisted that old age confronts us with our vulnerability and forces us to see what we often deny: that youth is not permanent, that time strips away illusions. Ecclesiastes anticipates this confrontation, refusing to sentimentalize aging. The imagery of broken cords and shattered bowls is brutal honesty: mortality will undo us.  

Paul Tillich, writing in *The Courage to Be*, insisted that meaning must be embraced even in the face of nonbeing. Remembering God in youth is an act of courage: it acknowledges finitude while rooting identity in the eternal. Hans Urs von Balthasar, Catholic theologian, went further: youth, he said, is not for self-indulgence alone but for vocation, for listening to God’s call early so that the trajectory of life bends toward Him.  

The Teacher’s wisdom is thus twofold. First, it is realism: you will age, you will weaken, you will die. Pretend otherwise, and you will be shattered when decline comes. Second, it is counsel: orient yourself toward God while strength is yours, so that when strength fades you do not lose yourself.  

Modern life resists this teaching. Our culture idolizes youth, markets cosmetics to defy age, praises productivity and beauty as if they were eternal. We distract ourselves with entertainment and technology to mask decline. But Ecclesiastes unmasks the illusion. The sun will darken, the silver cord will be severed, the dust will return to the ground. Denial cannot alter the truth.  

What then is the didactic lesson? Do not waste youth in forgetfulness. Remember your Creator while the heart is supple, while desire still burns, while memory can still be trained. To wait until the days of trouble is to fight a losing battle. Augustine would say: direct your restlessness early to its true home. Ricoeur would urge: weave God into your story before it frays. Beauvoir would warn: see aging not as tragedy but as truth, and resist a culture that hides it. Tillich would insist: have courage to face finitude by rooting in the eternal. Balthasar would challenge: hear God’s call in youth, and let it shape your vocation.  

Selene, in the story, could not stop the trembling of her hands or the dimming of her eyes. But she discovered that to remember the Creator in age is to recall what she once knew in youth. Though her voice cracked, the song was not lost. She found that what she remembered was not her own power but God’s faithfulness.  

And perhaps that is the strange gift of Ecclesiastes: to teach us that memory is not nostalgia but orientation. To remember God in youth is to prepare for old age, and to remember God in old age is to return to the One who never forgets. For when dust returns to the ground, the spirit returns to God who gave it.
