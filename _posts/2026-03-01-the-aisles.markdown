The first time I saw it, real theft, not a sneaky chocolate bar slipped under a sleeve but the full ransacking of shelves, I acted without thinking. A man swept razors, deodorant, packets of meat into a bag so quickly it looked rehearsed. I put out my arm, blocking his path like you’d block a child from stepping into traffic. He looked at me with an expression that wasn’t fear or anger, just a kind of weary indifference, and for a second I thought he might swing. It wasn’t him who made me back off, though. It was the staff, eyes wide, hands raised: let him go, please, just let him go. I obeyed, my chest hammering, still buzzing with useless adrenaline long after the automatic doors shushed closed behind him.

The second time, and the third, I tried words. *Come on, mate. Don’t do that.* My voice sounded staged, like bad dialogue in a cheap play. They ignored me. One smirked, another didn’t even turn his head. It dawned on me then that I wasn’t intervening, I was performing a little pantomime of civic virtue. My lines had no effect on the scene.

Now, when it happens, I do nothing. I watch. I feel the awkward tension of the staff who know better than to risk a knife for a bottle of whiskey or a tin of formula. I feel the flicker of shame at my stillness, but it doesn’t bite the way it used to. Ashamed in the way you’re ashamed of not giving change to the beggar at the crossing, ashamed in the way you’re ashamed of eating your lunch while someone else queues at the food bank, shame that evaporates by the time you reach your car.

And yet whenever I see it happen, the thought takes me back to Gateshead, to when I was nine years old and got my first invitation to do something bigger than nicking penny sweets. A boy I liked, he really was a nice boy, funny and loyal, good at football, asked me if I wanted to come with him and his older cousins to “TWOC” a car. Take Without Owner’s Consent. It was a phrase he said with pride, like a secret handshake. He spoke about it like it was a game: you take a screwdriver, you force the lock, you drive it down the road and ditch it before anyone catches you. His eyes gleamed with the thrill of it, and for a second I wanted to say yes. He was my friend. I wanted to belong.

But something in me, fear, conscience, maybe just cowardice, said no. I told him I’d promised my mam I’d be home for tea. He shrugged, didn’t make it a big deal. Suit yourself, he said, and ran off with the others.

That boy changed in the years that followed. Failed school. Stopped turning up altogether by Year Ten. Started hanging around the estate in a puffa jacket, always half looking over his shoulder. Then it was young offenders, a sentence for joyriding and burglary, the name whispered in the playground with both admiration and pity. He came back harder, quieter, with a look in his eyes that said he’d left the boy who invited me behind in a cell somewhere.

And I think of him often, when I see someone stuffing steaks down their coat in Tesco or dragging bottles of whiskey into a bag in Asda. I think about the sliding door that was his invitation and my refusal. I think about how small the gap was between us then, two nice lads kicking a ball against a wall, daring each other to spit off the footbridge, and how wide it is now.

There but for the grace of God go I. It’s a phrase I never liked in church because it sounded smug, but in the supermarket aisle it feels closer to truth. If I’d said yes that afternoon, if I’d gone with him, would I have followed his road? Would my name have been written into the same police notebook, stamped on the same court record? Or would I have bounced off like a coin flicked from a rail?

I don’t know. Nobody knows. That’s the joke of it: we tell ourselves we are the sum of our choices, but often we are the sum of our refusals. You say no to one thing at nine years old and spend the rest of your life congratulating yourself for being the kind of person who said no, when in truth it was luck, fear, or just the smell of your mam’s shepherd’s pie drawing you home.

So when I see the thefts now, the ransackings, the half-hearted attempts of staff to shout leave it, mate, I no longer feel the same bite of shame. I feel recognition. Not approval, not even forgiveness, just recognition. That boy from Gateshead is in every aisle, pocketing tins, ransacking shelves. The boy I might have been if I’d said yes.

The fault, I tell myself, lies not just with the thief but with the structures that leave us all to play our parts: the companies that choose margin over guards, the police who only respond when the theft tips a threshold, the shoppers who stand still and watch. And me, trolley in hand, knowing that whatever I do or don’t do, the aisles will be restocked by morning and the doors will open again.

So what is my response? To witness. To remember Gateshead. To hear the echo of my friend’s voice: Come on, it’ll be easy, just TWOC it. And to remember my own voice, small, nervous, cowardly, maybe wise, saying no. And to know that everything after unfolded from that no.

There but for the grace of God, indeed.
